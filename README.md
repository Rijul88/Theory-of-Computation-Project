# Theory-of-Computation-Project

I have implemented a Non-Determinsitc Finite Automata using C language
for the given problem statement. I have also attached the PDFs for the 
Assignments 1 and 2 which give a more detailed insight about the 
problem Statement.

The file TOC_ASSIGNMENT_1.c contains code for making an NFA for problem statement, 
creating an equivalent DFA and the telling whether the given string is accepted by the NFA or not.

The "input.txt" contains just two line, the first one contains an integer, and the second line contains the input string.
